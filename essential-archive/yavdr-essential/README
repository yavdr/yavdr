yaVDR-essential Readme
---------------------------------------

"yet another VDR" (yaVDR) is a Linux distribution focussed on Klaus Schmidingers Video Disk Recorder and based on Ubuntu 9.10 i386.

Although yaVDR 0.1.x works quite well already, there are many things that are either buggy or don't work automatically yet. So we don't recommend it for productive usage in case you have no experiences in configuring VDR manually.

yaVDR tries to let you:

    * Watch and record TV easily and enjoy your media in a smart way:  Quickly set up a digital video recorder (PVR) on your HTPC, receive SD and HD channels, manage it simply with a remote control. Furthermore, take advantage of the full blown media center software XBMC to listen to music, watch videos, check the weather. 

    * Enjoy High Definition without high CPU load: HDTV normally needs a strong CPU to be displayed flawlessly. If you own a Nvidia ION based nettop or a HTPC with a Nvidia GPU that supports VDPAU, your CPU will remain cool and your energy bill won't hurt you. yaVDR relies on VDPAU which is currently the only simple way to get GPU based HD video decoding on Linux.

    * Start immediately after turning on the HTPC: yaVDR wants to compete with other living room devices as much as possible using upstart to speed up the boot. Besides that, the shutdown method S3 (Suspend to RAM) is enabled by default to bypass cold boot. It is possible to let the system automatically wake up on timers and go to sleep after a configurable timeout.

    * Profit from our work, even if you don't install yaVDR: If a complete distribution is not the right thing for you and you still want to use the latest VDR packages with your ordinary Ubuntu 9.10: No problem! Just use the Launchpad repositories yaVDR is based on. Install the selection of VDR packages that you need.
