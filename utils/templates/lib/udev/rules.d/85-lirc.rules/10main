#These rules are currently only adapted for a single lirc device.
#They are mainly used for hotplugability of the USB devices
#So that the user won't have to restart the lircd process.
#
#If a user has multiple lirc devices, and removes one of them
#The other will stop working as well.  This is a side effect
#of both this udev script as well as the lirc architecture
#Of chaining lircd processes.

# NOTE: This has been disabled by yavdr webfrontend. This is causing 
# reproducable problems at karmic
